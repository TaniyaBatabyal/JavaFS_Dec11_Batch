3. Example of Pre increment operator: ++a
   Example of Post increment operator: a++
   Example of Pre decrement operator: --a
   Example of Post decrement operator: a--

5. String : String is a sequence of characters. But in java string is an object that represents sequence of character.
   For example: String name="ram"//it is take 6 bytes
                String name="ramakant"//16 bytes
   first store string name is ram it will take memory size is 6 bytes. After that when it is changed to ramakant it's take 16 bytes that 
   is not possible to store in the same memory location because size is different for that reason string is called as immutable. 

6. String name1 = "ram";
   String name2 = "ram";
   above two strings are equal. First name1 ram is store in memory location. When name2 ram is assigned and try to stored in memory 
   location then with the help of string pool both strings are store in same location because both strings are same. But if String name2 is
   declear as new string("ram") then it will store in different location because it is declear as new string.New string will take space in 
   heap memory.
    
8. In terms of speed, Java is faster than Python as it is a compiled language. It takes less time to execute a code.
   Python is an interpreted language and it determines the type of data at run time which makes it slower comparatively.
